# RIFT-SP111

**RIFT** (Row-Indexed Flex-Translator) is a modular, grammar-aware compiler pipeline designed by OBINexus.  
This repo implements `SP111`, the first joint **stage**/**process** phase beyond raw tokenization (RIFT-0).  

- `S` = Stage-bound (semantic gating, waterfall-locked)
- `P` = Process-bound (runtime-bound, fault-tolerant)

This repo models grammar-intent evaluation and unlocks RIFT-1 parsing through semantic token flow confidence, defined in the `.rift-gov/` control layer.

> ðŸš§ Currently in POC phase.  
> ðŸ“„ Formal documentation will be published via `.tex` and OBINexus GitHub Pages.
